Start a babysitter orchestration run. Creates a new run using the SDK, binds it to the current session, and begins iteration.

This command initialises a fresh babysitter run with the given prompt, associates it with the active oh-my-pi session, and kicks off the first orchestration iteration. The loop driver will continue iterating automatically on subsequent `agent_end` events until the run completes, fails, or a guard trips.

## Usage

```
/babysitter:call "build feature X"
/babysitter:call "refactor the auth module to use JWT"
```

## Behaviour

1. Creates a new run via the SDK (`createRun`).
2. Binds the run to the current oh-my-pi session (`bindRun`).
3. Runs the first orchestration iteration (`iterate`).
4. Injects a continuation prompt if effects are pending.

## Notes

- Only one run can be active per session. Starting a new run while one is active will replace it.
- The run directory defaults to `BABYSITTER_RUNS_DIR` (`.a5c/runs`).
- Use `/babysitter:status` to check progress and `/babysitter:resume` to pick up a stopped run.
